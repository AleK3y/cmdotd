I use this as kind of a welcome screen when opening my terminal:

## Requirements
The first time you run it, you have to have internet turned on. Otherwise you can copy one of the mirrors to be a cachefile in `~/.cache/cmdotd/manpages.json`.

For it to run you have to install these modules:
```
- requests
- colorama
```
